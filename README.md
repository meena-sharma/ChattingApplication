Description:
This repository contains a basic client-server chat application written in Java, utilizing Swing for the graphical user interface and Java sockets for network communication.

Features:
Client Interface: A simple GUI with text input, a send button, and a chat display panel. The client connects to a server, sends messages, and displays received messages.
Server Interface: A corresponding GUI on the server-side that listens for client connections, receives messages, and displays them.
Networking: Uses Java sockets to establish communication between the client and server, with DataInputStream and DataOutputStream for data transmission.
Message Formatting: Messages are displayed in a formatted panel, including timestamps for each message.
This application demonstrates fundamental concepts in Java networking and GUI development.
